## üîê Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Key Management
- **Strong Passwords**: Use 12+ character passwords with symbols
- **Key Backup**: Store backups in secure, separate locations
- **Key Rotation**: Rotate keys every 90 days
- **Access Control**: Limit who has access to private keys

#### Operational Security
- **Air-Gapped Systems**: Use offline systems for maximum security
- **Regular Updates**: Keep NovaEncryptor updated to latest version
- **Audit Reviews**: Regularly review audit logs
- **Secure Deletion**: Use secure file deletion for sensitive data

#### Environment Security
- **Virtual Environment**: Always use isolated Python environments
- **File Permissions**: Ensure proper file system permissions
- **Network Isolation**: Avoid network exposure during crypto operations
- **Physical Security**: Protect systems with sensitive keys

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **Error Handling**: Implement secure error handling
- **Memory Management**: Use secure memory operations
- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated

#### Testing
- **Security Testing**: Include security-focused test cases
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Code Review**: Peer review for security issues
- **Static Analysis**: Use security scanning tools

## üèõÔ∏è Compliance

### Standards Compliance

- **NIST SP 800-57**: Key management guidelines
- **FIPS 140-2**: Cryptographic module standards
- **Common Criteria**: Security evaluation criteria
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management

### Audit Support

NovaEncryptor provides features to support security audits:
- **Comprehensive logging** of all cryptographic operations
- **Immutable audit trails** with timestamps
- **Key lifecycle tracking** and rotation logs
- **Access control monitoring**

## üîç Security Architecture

### Threat Model

#### Threats Addressed
- **Data Interception**: AES-256-GCM provides confidentiality
- **Data Tampering**: GCM mode provides authentication
- **Key Compromise**: RSA-4096 provides forward secrecy
- **Password Attacks**: Argon2 provides resistance
- **Memory Dumps**: Secure deletion prevents exposure

#### Threats Not Addressed
- **Physical Access**: Does not protect against physical compromise
- **Side-Channel Attacks**: Not hardened against timing attacks
- **Quantum Computing**: Not post-quantum secure
- **Social Engineering**: Relies on proper key management

### Security Assumptions

- **Trusted Execution Environment**: Assumes secure OS/hardware
- **Secure Random Number Generation**: Relies on OS entropy
- **Cryptographic Library Security**: Trusts PyCA Cryptography
- **User Competence**: Assumes proper usage by users

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Testing

### Automated Testing

Run security tests with:

```bash
# Security static analysis
bandit -r src/nova_encryptor.py

# Dependency vulnerability check
safety check

# Code quality analysis
flake8 src/nova_encryptor.py

# Comprehensive test suite
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### Manual Testing

#### Cryptographic Testing
1. **Key Generation**: Verify randomness and strength
2. **Encryption/Decryption**: Test with various message sizes
3. **Password Protection**: Test with different password strengths
4. **Error Conditions**: Test failure modes

#### Security Testing
1. **Memory Leaks**: Check for sensitive data in memory
2. **File Permissions**: Verify secure file access
3. **Audit Logs**: Validate logging completeness
4. **Input Validation**: Test with malformed inputs
